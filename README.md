# Face Detection using OpenCV and LBP Cascade Classifier
This repository contains code for a face detection model using OpenCV and LBP Cascade Classifier.

### Overview
The model is built using OpenCV library and LBP Cascade Classifier, which is a type of object detection algorithm. The classifier has been trained on a large dataset of faces, which allows it to detect faces with high accuracy. The model can be used to detect faces in images or in real-time video streams.
